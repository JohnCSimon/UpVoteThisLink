# Up Vote This Link

Idea: Given a link somewhere like `https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/m4cn6j/crust_of_rust_the_drop_check/` I want to click a link and select an emoji response. This emoji response will appear in a dynamically generated emoji strip image that can be linked to on a board.

This is a feature missing in a lot of old-school phpbb message board software packages - so this is a cheesy way to hack it in. 

I'm mostly doing this to do more Rust. :)
